This is a Project to simulate airport traffic and was implemented by c.

Basically, airplanes need time to take off, fly, landing and stay. If a runway is occupied by an airplane to take of or landing, then other airplanes need to cycle around the airport to wait. 

This simulation simulates the average waiting time for the airplane to wait if we keep increasing the number of airplanes. 

The priority queue part was implemented by red-black tree data structure.
